	\section{Introduction}
	Nowadays concurrent programs are very common in order to make use of 'hyper-threading and multi-core architectures'\cite[p. 14]{SWB-1830643851}. 'Due to the highly non-deterministic behavior of concurrent programs' \cite[p. 1]{sulzmann} data races may arise but can also be hard to find, as they also 'may only arise under a specific schedule' \cite[p. 1]{sulzmann}. This seminar work shows the motivation and background for the data prediction tool ThreadSanitizer (TSan) V2, which differentiates itself from the first version by utilizing happens-before methods instead of the lockset method. Afterwards the concepts of the FastTrack \cite{cormac} algorithm will be shown as TSan uses a slightly modified version of the FastTrack algorithm. Examples showing the limits of FastTrack and TSan follow, as they are both incomplete and thus do not find every data race. In the following the same notation as in \cite{sulzmann} will be used for traces and events.
	
%	\begin{description}
%		\item[data race] concurrent programs prone to data races, due to highly nondeterministic nature. 2 conflicting events next to each other in trace
%		\item[conflicting event] 2 read/write events, at least one event is write event
%		\item[dynamic data race prediction] predict trace orderings that exhibit data races
%		\item[exhaustive predictive methods] identify as many orderings as possible
%		\item[efficient predictive methods] \(O(n)\) runtime, compromise completeness and soundness
%		\item[HB relation] events can be ordered by happens-before relation and if they can't that means they can be ordered in a way that they are next to each other in the trace $\rightarrow$ data race
%		\item[vector clocks] used to represent happens-before relation, if incomparable then data race
%		\item[epochs] vector clocks need \(O(n)\) time and space, instead epochs can be used which consist of time stamp j and thread id k $\rightarrow$ j\#k
%	\end{description}

	\section{Motivation and Examples}
	As stated in the introduction concurrent programs are commonly used and are inherently prone to data races. Data races can be hard to find and might not be apparent. This chapter will show a few examples from \cite{sulzmann2} but rewritten in the programming language C++. The following example shows a program, which exhibits a data race (see chapter \ref{background-sec}):
	\lstinputlisting[caption={Program containing conflicting events}, label={lst:conflicting}, language=C++]{conflicting_event.cpp}
	Acquiring and releasing a lock is accomplished by the \texttt{pthread\_mutex\_lock()}- and the \texttt{pthread\_mutex\_unlock()}-method. The following trace can be generated for the program \ref{lst:conflicting}:
	\begin{table}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c c c}
				& 1\# & 2\# \\
				\hline
				1. & w(x) & \\
				2. & acq(y) & \\
				3. & rel(y) & \\
				4. & & acq(y) \\
				5. & & w(x) \\
				6. & & rel(y) \\
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Possible trace of listing \ref{lst:conflicting}}
			\label{trace1}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	In the trace \ref{trace1} the events $1\#w(x)_1$ and $2\#w(x)_5$ do not appear right next to each other which might indicate that these two events are not part of a data race. By rerunning the program \ref{lst:conflicting} eventually the following trace can be obtained:
	\begin{table}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c c c}
				& 1\# & 2\# \\
				\hline
				4. & & acq(y) \\
				5. & & w(x) \\
				1. & w(x) & \\
				6. &  & rel(y) \\
				2. & acq(y) & \\
				3. & rel(y) & \\
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Possible trace of listing \ref{lst:conflicting}}
			\label{trace2}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	The trace \ref{trace2} shows the two events $1\#w(x)_1$ and $2\#w(x)_5$ are now right next to each other and hence they are part of a data race. This only became apparent after reordering the original trace \ref{trace1} which shows that data races may be hard to detect in some cases.
	\section{Background}\label{background-sec}
		\subsection{Dynamic Data Race Prediction}
		The method of reordering traces to try to predict data races is called dynamic data race prediction, see \cite[p. 2]{sulzmann2} for more details, and will be discussed in this work. The approach of finding all reorderings is used in exhaustive predictive methods. Since modern programs may utilize multiple threads each executing large blocks of code, finding all possible reorderings might not always be feasible. Therefore effective predictive methods are employed which compromise completeness and soundness for better coverage. FastTrack and TSan are examples for dynamic data race prediction using effective predictive methods. Sulzmann and Stadtm\"uller \cite[p. 2]{sulzmann} define completeness and soundness as follows:
		\begin{quote}
			Sound means that races reported by the algorithm can be observed via some appropriate reordering of the trace. If unsound, we refer to wrongly a classiﬁed race as a \textit{false positive}. Complete means that all valid reorderings that exhibit some race can be predicted by the algorithm. If incomplete, we refer to any not reported race as a \textit{false negative}.
		\end{quote}
		\subsection{Data Race}
		Sulzmann and Stadtm\"uller \cite[p. 1]{sulzmann} define a data race as follows: 
		\begin{quote}
			Let \textit{e}, \textit{f} be two read/write events on the same variable where at least one of them is a write event and both events result from different threads. Then, we say that \textit{e} and \textit{f} are two \textit{conflicting events}. [...] [I]f two conflicting events can appear right next to each other [,then s]uch a situation represents a \textit{data race}.
		\end{quote}
		An example of a data race can be seen in the trace \ref{trace2}.
		\subsection{Happens-Before Relation}
		As stated in \cite[p. 4]{sulzmann2}, the happens-before relation is used to partially order the events in a system. The happens-before relation is defined as a strict partial order so the ordering is transitive but irreflexive. If the event \textit{e} is ordered before the event \textit{f} then $e <^{HB} f$ applies, where $<^{HB}$ denotes the
