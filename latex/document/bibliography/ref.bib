	abstract = {Data races are often discussed in the context of lock acquisition and release, with race-detection algorithms routinely relying on vector clocks as a means of capturing the relative ordering of events from different threads. In this paper, we present a data-race detector for a language with channel communication as its sole synchronization primitive, and provide a semantics directly tied to the happens-before relation, thus forging the notion of vector clocks.}
